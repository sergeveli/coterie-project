# coterie-project

This a project utilizing custom built .NET Core APIs on the backend and React-Redux on the frontend.
The backend APIs have been tested using curl commands and all work. However, issues arose when connecting 
the front to the back. A consistent CORS error appeared within console and prevented the app to function as intended. After examining Microsoft's documentation for CORS as well as React's and attemtping to debug over the course of the past 48 hours, this is the code as it currently stands. I am open to any discussions, feedback and questions. Thank You.
